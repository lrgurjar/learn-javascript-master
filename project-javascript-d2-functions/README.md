## Project Title: Color Picker

1. Create a html file with your name like john.html
2. Add current code to that file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <script>
      // your code here
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

3. Define a global variable named `color` with `const` and set it to `blue`

4. Declare a function named `logColor1` without parameter and log `color` variable into console.

5. Declare a function named `logColor2` with a parameter named `color` and log `color` variable into console.

6. Call function `logColor2` with `'red'` as argument and check the result.

7. Declare a function named `logColor3` with a parameter named `color` and log `color` variable into console.

8. In this function, add an if statement before `console.log` that check `color` is green. If it is green use `let` to define a variable named `color` and set it `light green`, then `console.log(color)`

9. Call function `logColor3` with `'green'` as argument and check the result.

10. Analyze and discuss the behaviour of scoping in all steps.
