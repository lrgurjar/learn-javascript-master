## Project Title: College Cost Calculator

1. Create a html file with your name like john.html
2. Add current code to that file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <script>
      // your code here
    </script>

```

3. For a 4 years college degree, define two variables:

- Annual cost: \$35000
- Inflation rate: %5

All variables are number.

`For a 4 years college degree with annual cost: ${annualCost} and inflation rate: ${inflationRate}, you have to pay ${totalCost}.`

5. Imagine you have 5 years to save money for college. How much do you need to save annually to afford the college cost? Log the result into console like this:
